# Hi, I´m Stella 😊

Welcome to my Github!  
I am currently partcicipating in a **Coding-Bootcamp**.

But the crazy part is I´m liking it 😬  

Right now I´m in the midst of planing my final project, which I will be working on over the next four weeks.

So stay tuned for the most amazing Book-Track-App out there 💪🏼
